# WORK IN PROGRESS!
## Description
Shooter helper is a program that tries to give you more statistics, data and insights to your shots at the range.

## What will the program do?
 - From Meyton coordinates images or from a csv import your shots
 - Make statistics about your performance
 - Give you more insight to your shots
 - Analyze every shot
 
# Point of the program
I have been a part of a Shooting club for 5 years now, and recenty I got the idea to make a picture of every shot's coordinates.
And I tought what a fun way to one learn interesting topics in computer science / programming and also improve my shooting skills with a little bit of more insight.
On the range we have Meyton Elektronik targets.
